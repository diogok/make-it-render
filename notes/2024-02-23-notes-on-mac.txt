Notes on MacOSX

Apple is famous for it's locked down ecosystem, and it really shows.

Everything is focused on using Swift on XCode on MacOSX on Apple hardware. Even Object-c seems like a second-rank language in terms of support, and C just happens to work.

Using the MacOSX SDK (the Frameworks) is only allowed on Apple hardware. VMs are only allowed on Apple hardware. There is no support for anything outside Apple.

I don't own a Mac, so I wonder if I can even make it work.

Documentation is confusing, because I need to go back and forth between the objc-runtime, bridgesupport and objc/swift docs to understand the arguments and return of a function. Also a lot is not documented, as it just stated "if you are using XCode this is taken care for you".

There is also not much references and complete working code I can look into. There are some great bindings and generators in zig that can be used as reference, but technically those need to (or should...) be built on a Mac (if I understood correctly).

Object-c actually looks like a fine language, but I have not really used it to know.

By dynamicaly loading the libraries I think I am not going against the terms of Apple, because I did not download, link or ditribute any of the SDK. But hard to tell really.

So I built on Linux and tested on someone else's Mac until an window appeared.

The result works, but it is pretty clear that I am fighting against the system on this one. Apple does not want software like mine, it seems. But I persist, at least a little longer.

This was the most frustating part so far.
