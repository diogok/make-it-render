Notes on Windows

Windows, being a GUI focused OS, I expected it would be easy to create a window. And that is correct, it is super easy.

A good thing about Windows for this context is that you can expect some basic functions will always be there.

What made it super easy is that you can always count on win32 APIs, and operating a Window is the focus of a lot of it.

Like any good legacy API there are quirks, but honestly not too bad.

The most curious thing I found are the thousands of errors codes that some of those are not really errors and you have to ignore them sometimes. I am sure there is a reason.

MS also provides free VMs for evaluation and tests, which makes it easy to test and develop on, and windows run in a lot of hardware.

Mingw64, wine and many other tools are available to develop for Windows from Linux.

This is working on x86_64 and arm64. Tested only on Windows 11.

I think it will work out nicely.
